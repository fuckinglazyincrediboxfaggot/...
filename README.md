;' Life's too short for us, mortals. Children dying of severe accidents and by criminals while the adults die of old age. Well, I'd die in my sleep. It's painless. I wish we're still children where we are always playing outside, but these criminals.. we can't go outside while they roam. They'd attack us even minors and adults. It's so short. Do we really deserve it? I want to live but i can't with these criminals like groomers and pedophiles. I wish children and adults are safe at this time with these people roaming. I wish life was easier. I wish so. I hope they didn't exist, but, it'd would lower the population of humanity. Why are they important anyways? And, plus, if we're adults, we should focused on work, taxes, files, etc.. And I wish sexual assualt never existed. It sucks like hell. Once again, I hope you stay safe. Goodbye. '
